# Philosophy

CIVITAS is a society-first roleplay framework. It provides primitives for
organizations, access control, and assets so server owners can model
institutions (government, law enforcement, businesses, criminal groups)
using one shared abstraction: organizations.

Core tenets:
- No built-in jobs or automated economic loops.
- No XP, grind, or progression systems.
- Permission and authority are modeled via organizations, ranks, and
	explicit permission grants (RBAC). Deny rules override allows.
- Resources communicate via exports and events only; persistence and
	gameplay integration are left to server implementers.
